Notes on Quantum generalisation of feedforward neural networks
==============================================================

This paper gives a twist on gradient descent to train neural networks of the quantum generalization of classical tasks. One of the examples is an autoencoder: a [related and equally interesting paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02806) came out a few days later, which is also worth reading.

From Oscar Dahlsten: If you have any comments/feedback I and the other authors are very keen to communicate about it. We are developing it further at the moment in terms of theory and working with experimenters. Please notify me on oscar.dahlsten@physics.ox.ac.uk if you write something I should reply to.
